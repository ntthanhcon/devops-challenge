**Overview Diagram of the Services Used**

The architecture is designed to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability while maintaining low latency for trading operations. Below is a breakdown of key AWS services and their roles:

AWS Route 53: Provides domain name resolution and failover handling.

AWS CloudFront: Serves as a CDN to optimize delivery of static assets.

AWS WAF & AWS Shield: Protect against DDoS attacks and ensure security.

AWS API Gateway: Manages API traffic and enforces rate limits.

AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming requests across multiple backend services.

AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or AWS ECS (Fargate): Hosts the microservices responsible for trade execution, order matching, and account management.

AWS Aurora PostgreSQL or DynamoDB: Stores transactional data with high availability and replication.

AWS ElastiCache (Redis): Caches frequently accessed data to improve response times.

AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) & Simple Notification Service (SNS): Manages asynchronous event-driven processing.

AWS Kinesis: Handles real-time processing of market data.

Amazon S3: Stores trade logs, backups, and reports.

AWS CloudWatch & ELK Stack: Centralized monitoring and logging for insights and troubleshooting.

Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) & Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Automatically scales services based on demand.

**Plans for Scaling Beyond Initial Setup**

To accommodate growth, the following scaling strategies will be implemented:

Database Scaling:

Read replicas for AWS Aurora.

Sharding strategy for DynamoDB.

Using a hybrid approach (SQL + NoSQL) for performance optimization.

Compute Scaling:

Horizontal scaling using AWS EKS/ECS with HPA.

More worker nodes in Auto Scaling Groups (ASG).

Deployment of microservices in multiple AWS regions.

Traffic Scaling:

API Gateway throttling and request caching.

Multi-region ALB setup with AWS Global Accelerator.

Event Processing Scaling:

Implementing Kinesis Data Firehose for stream aggregation.

Scaling Kafka/MSK clusters for higher throughput.

Monitoring and Logging Enhancements:

Centralized logging using ELK Stack and CloudWatch Insights.

AI-driven anomaly detection for proactive issue resolution.

**Conclusion**
By implementing these scaling strategies, the trading system can handle an increasing number of users while maintaining a p99 response time of <100ms and sustaining 500 requests per second efficiently.
